# PwshKit

PwshKit is a minimalist toolkit for a smarter PowerShell experience. In essence, it is a collection of tools and utilities that I use to make my PowerShell experience more efficient and enjoyable. It has an accompanying CLI tool that allows to install, manage and updates the tools and utilities.
